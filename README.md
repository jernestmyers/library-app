### project 1 from the odin project's full stack javascript course
library makes use of an object constructor that builds an array of book objects to be added or removed from display. i chose to utilize a form on the left container for users to input the book information. books display in a table in the main body of the page. users have 3 choices that can be amended after displaying the book: read it, reading it, wish to read.
